This plugin enables using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as the bundler for Piral instances and pilets.

## Installation

Use your favorite npm client for the installation:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-rollup --save-dev
```

**Note**: If you don't install any bundler for use in `piral-cli` then `piral-cli-rollup` will be automatically installed for you.

## Using

There is nothing to do. Standard commands such as `piral build` or `pilet debug` will now work with Rollup as the bundler.

This plugin comes with batteries included. You don't need to install or specify your Rollup version.

### What's Inside

Right now it includes:

- tbd

As such it should be prepared to include assets (images, videos, ...), stylesheets (CSS and SASS), and work with TypeScript.

### Customizing
